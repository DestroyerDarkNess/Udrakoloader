## Introduction
Udrakoloader is a mod, Currently Compatible With SAMP and HALO [Possibly With many more games]. 
Provides the ability to load scripts (DLL) developed in .Net into the game.

Based on [ScriptHookvDotNet](https://github.com/crosire/scripthookvdotnet) and [SharpNeedle](https://github.com/ChadSki/SharpNeedle) . Basically consists of CLR Hosting, to run the .Net plugins.

-- I don't take credit for this for the following reasons:

- Most of the code is from the SharpNeedle project, Modified with parts of ScriptHookvDotNet for more compatibility.
